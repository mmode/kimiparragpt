        I have always been into keeping fit, particularly athletics and gymnastics. Working with clients, I effectively introduce exercise and nutritional behaviour into daily life to promote an overall better quality of life. 
        <br><br>
        As a Personal Trainer I care, support and train a broad range of clients: busy professionals, housewives (or husbands!), pre and post natal women, sports people, younger and older adults to name just a few. I am part of the Active Ageing Programme. I am interested in balancing and strengthening the connection between the mind and body - making you fitter and healthier both physically and mentally. 
        <br><br>
        Not comfortable going to the gym? No problem as I am equipped to train you wherever you prefer whether in a garden, park or in the comfort of your own home. All programmes start with a free consultation so that I can meet you and understand your goals, therefore personalising the plan to suit you. Open to all ages, shapes and fitness levels, as well as working with those who may have suffered a previous injury seeking rehabilitation. 
        <br><br>
        We will work at your own pace but without wasting any time in getting you to your goal. All of us lead such busy lives making it difficult to get to the gym on a regular basis, which is why I work around you. I offer fitness tests, advice, one-off sessions and of course short and long-term programmes with no strings attached.
